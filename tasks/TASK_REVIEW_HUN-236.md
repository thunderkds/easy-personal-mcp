# TASK_REVIEW — HUN-236: Live view opens a session inline with one-line feed rows (FR-085)

> Sibling of `tasks/TASK_GUIDE_HUN-236.md`. Everything here is **filled by the reviewer at Stage
> 4/5** — it is deliberately NOT in the guide, because the implementing agent re-reads the guide on
> every turn and never fills these two sections.
>
> Consumers resolve each section **guide first, this file second** (`.claude/hooks/lib/guide_sections.py`):
> a legacy guide that still carries these sections inline keeps working unchanged, and a stray
> review file can never override an inline section.

## Auto decisions

Mode: auto
Owner instruction (not a decision): "look good now, but the line is too long with the logs, and the UX for click to show and hide is not good, let investigate and update [auto]" (2026-11-06).
1. inline expand under the row replaces the FR-072 side panel (new FR-085; PRD open question 29) — SAFER OPTION: fixes both complaints with one change (full-width feed; no layout shift; feed next to the tapped row on phones); the side panel was the owner's 2026-11-04 choice ⚠ decided for you — please review
2. MCP feed rows show only `server · tool` (raw name moves to the row `title`); time `HH:MM:SS` 24 h; one line per row with ellipsis — RULE: same Supervisor choice as 1 (owner: "the line is too long") ⚠ decided for you — please review
3. the expanded area shows the feed only (row bars already show the session's totals) — SAFER OPTION: smaller change, no lost data (totals stay on the row) ⚠ decided for you — please review
4. Complexity C2 (restructure of the Live view open/close), Risk Low (UI only, no data) — RULE: `agents/frontend.md` Complexity matrix
5. spawned on claude · C2 → claude-sonnet-5-5 — FACT: PROJECT_SPEC.md:165 "| claude | `claude` | `claude-haiku-5-5` | `claude-sonnet-5-5` | `claude-sonnet-5-5` |"
Checks: pending
Not done: merge (yours); auto verify: running (T182)

## Evidence

| Check | Result | Notes / output snippet |
|-------|--------|------------------------|
| **New test(s) cover Acceptance Criteria (file paths pasted)** | ☐ pass / ☐ fail | [test file path(s) — required before Done] |
| Verification command run | ☐ pass / ☐ fail | [paste actual output] |
| Negative cases hold | ☐ pass / ☐ fail | |
| verify | ☐ pass / ☐ fail / ☐ N/A | [what was observed — must literally state "pass" or "fail" here too, e.g. "skill run, feature confirmed working — pass": the merge gate scans this Notes column for the word "pass", not just the Result column] |
| Review scope bounded to the change's blast radius (affected set, not whole repo) | ☐ pass / ☐ fail | [what was reviewed vs. skipped, and why] |
| Full smoke suite still green (no regression) | ☐ pass / ☐ fail | |
| **Companion score (easy-verifier)** | ☐ pass / ☐ fail / ☐ N/A | [`overall` and `change_risk` as the tool returned them, the scope, the ref, and the absolute path of the verifier report after a literal `report:` label — e.g. "overall 86 (>= 80), change_risk pass, scope changes, ref `main...HEAD`, report: `/home/me/.easy-verifier-reports/kit/score_changes_20261028T0530Z.html`". The gate reads the path that follows `report:` and nothing else, so with no label, or a path that is absent, the row is unscored — write ☑ N/A instead. ☑ N/A with a reason when neither companion tool was run: the merge gate blocks on ☑ fail only, never on an absent or N/A row] |
| **UI: Visual regression (diff or verdict pasted)** | ☐ pass / ☐ fail / ☐ N/A | [screenshot path or LLM verdict — required for UI tasks, Hard-Stop Gate 6] |
| **UI: Design-system compliance (tokens/colors/typography verified)** | ☐ pass / ☐ fail / ☐ N/A | [method used + output] |
| **UI: Responsiveness at target viewports** | ☐ pass / ☐ fail / ☐ N/A | [viewports tested, any overflow findings] |

## Demonstration

> Anchors what this task delivered to an observable before/after pair. BEFORE has no `N/A` path:
> if the task changes executable code, BEFORE is a pasted, timestamped terminal capture taken
> **before any implementation commit exists**; if it does not (docs, templates, skill-instruction
> text), BEFORE is the **verbatim prior content** of what changed — a quoted excerpt, not a command.

**BEFORE**: [pasted timestamped command output showing the thing absent/failing, captured before the
first implementation commit] OR [verbatim excerpt of the prior content, for non-executable changes]

**AFTER**: [same command, post-change] OR [verbatim excerpt of the new content]

**DELTA**: [one sentence — what a user can now do that they could not before]

**WITNESS**: [who ran it and when — derived from `memory/event-trace/HUN-236.jsonl`, never the
implementing agent alone]
