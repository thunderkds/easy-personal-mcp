# TASK_REVIEW — HUN-50: Dashboard usage view: summary, breakdowns, session timeline, "not included" notice

> Sibling of `tasks/TASK_GUIDE_HUN-50.md`. Everything here is **filled by the reviewer at Stage
> 4/5** — it is deliberately NOT in the guide, because the implementing agent re-reads the guide on
> every turn and never fills these two sections.
>
> Consumers resolve each section **guide first, this file second** (`.claude/hooks/lib/guide_sections.py`):
> a legacy guide that still carries these sections inline keeps working unchanged, and a stray
> review file can never override an inline section.

## Evidence

| Check | Result | Notes / output snippet |
|-------|--------|------------------------|
| **New test(s) cover Acceptance Criteria (file paths pasted)** | ☐ pass / ☐ fail | [test file path(s) — required before Done] |
| Verification command run | ☐ pass / ☐ fail | [paste actual output] |
| Negative cases hold | ☐ pass / ☐ fail | |
| verify | ☐ pass / ☐ fail / ☐ N/A | [what was observed — must literally state "pass" or "fail" here too, e.g. "skill run, feature confirmed working — pass": the merge gate scans this Notes column for the word "pass", not just the Result column] |
| Review scope bounded to the change's blast radius (affected set, not whole repo) | ☐ pass / ☐ fail | [what was reviewed vs. skipped, and why] |
| Full smoke suite still green (no regression) | ☐ pass / ☐ fail | |
| easy-verifier score (advisory) | ☐ recorded / ☐ N/A | [overall result, abstaining dimensions, report path — or `N/A — <reason>` if the server is down; never blocks Done] |
| **UI: Visual regression (diff or verdict pasted)** | ☐ pass / ☐ fail / ☐ N/A | [screenshot path or LLM verdict — required for UI tasks, Hard-Stop Gate 6] |
| **UI: Design-system compliance (tokens/colors/typography verified)** | ☐ pass / ☐ fail / ☐ N/A | [method used + output] |
| **UI: Responsiveness at target viewports** | ☐ pass / ☐ fail / ☐ N/A | [viewports tested, any overflow findings] |

## Demonstration

> Anchors what this task delivered to an observable before/after pair. BEFORE has no `N/A` path:
> if the task changes executable code, BEFORE is a pasted, timestamped terminal capture taken
> **before any implementation commit exists**; if it does not (docs, templates, skill-instruction
> text), BEFORE is the **verbatim prior content** of what changed — a quoted excerpt, not a command.

**BEFORE**: captured 2026-10-22T03:41:47Z in the HUN-50 worktree, before any implementation commit:

```
$ npm --prefix web test
npm error Missing script: "test"
$ cat web/src/main.jsx
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<p>easy-personal dashboard placeholder</p>)
```

**AFTER**: 2026-10-22, same worktree:

```
$ npm --prefix web test
 Test Files  2 passed (2)
      Tests  22 passed (22)
$ npm --prefix web run build   -> built; check_static: ok
```

**DELTA**: the owner can open the dashboard page and see usage totals, breakdowns by day/model/project/tool, outlier sessions and a session timeline, with cost labelled API-equivalent and a "not included" notice.

**WITNESS**: [who ran it and when — derived from `memory/event-trace/Txxx.jsonl`, never the
implementing agent alone]
